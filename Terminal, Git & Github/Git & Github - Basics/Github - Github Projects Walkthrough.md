### What is GitHub?

> **GitHub Projects** is a built-in planning tool where teams can **organize tasks, track progress, and manage workflows**.  
> It connects directly to issues and pull requests and helps structure work visually.  
>
> **Think of it as:**  
> 	_“A project board for your code - where tasks, planning, and progress live together.”_

### Why GitHub Projects?

GitHub Projects helps teams plan and track work directly next to their code.

**Visual planning**  
Board and timeline views give a clear overview of progress.

**Issues as user stories**  
Tasks are connected to real development work.

**Multiple repositories**  
One project can include issues from several repositories.

**Clear workflow**  
Custom statuses and fields help structure the process.

GitHub Projects keeps planning, tasks, and code in one place.

### Step by Step - Guide

#### Step 1 - Creating a new Github Project

> [!example]  Step 1
> 1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)  
> 2. Create a new Repository
> 3. Once created: click `Github Projects` 
>    ![[Github_Projects_Guide_1_tab.png]]
> 4. Click: `New Project`  
> 	1. `link project` if you want to connect another Repository
> 5. Pick `Team Planning` _(great standard)_
>    ![[Github_Projects_Guide_2_type.png|250]]
> 6. **Optional**: When asked about 'bulk import of items', make sure it's checked then create the project _(if 0 items are added, this won't matter)_

#### Step 2 - The Backlog

> **Heads up**: it's important to understand `user stories / technical stories` check them out at: [[User Stories vs Technical User Stories]] 

> [!example]  Step 2
> 1. Create a new `User-/Technical story`
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.23.17.png|250]]
> 2. By making it an issue, we connect the Issue-ID with the given `User-/Technical Story` for ease of access. 
>    _(You can - at any given time - convert a `User-/Technical Story` into an issue)_
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.24.14.png|350]]
> 	1. Click: Blank Issue
> 	   ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.35.51.png]]
> 	2. Decide upon a title, and a clear given instruction so that any person can pick this story up and begin working without confusion.
> 	   ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.37.38.png]]
> 3. Navigate into the newly created `Story`
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.39.25.png|350]]
> 	1. Within each `Story` we can effectively add extra details as a complementary to its description.
> 	   ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.40.59.png]]
> 	2. ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.41.11.png]]
> 	3. ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.41.27.png]]
> 	4. ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.41.43.png]]
> 	5. ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.41.57.png|400]]

#### Step 3 - Sprints & Iterations

> **Heads up**: Understanding Sprints & Scrum Terminologies is essential and ultimately facilitates the planning and setup of iterations as discussed within their respective internal teams, proceed with this knowledge in hand.

> [!example]  Step 3
> 1. Navigate to Settings _(upper right section of the board)_
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.53.46.png|350]]
> 2. Navigate towards the `Iteration` section
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.54.38.png|350]]
> 3. Remove all pre-existing iterations, as we will create new ones ahead
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.55.54.png|650]]
> 4. Click `More Options` dropdown, and change to 1-week iteration 
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 10.58.00.png|350]]
>    This is essentially setting our sprint to be exactly a week long
> 5. In this case we prepare 4 sprints _(1 month)_ 
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 11.00.10.png|650]]
>    **Make sure you click SAVE**
> 6. Navigate to the `iteration`tab and click one of the `stories` there
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 11.03.41.png]]
> 7. You can now assign relevant `stories`to current iterative sprint
>    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 11.03.24.png|250]]
>    **NOTE: Only light planning for future sprints**

> [!success]  
> **Next step is to get started with Agile workflows, get started!**

### Why this matters

Using GitHub Projects with **Issues and Sprints** gives structure to your development work.  
It helps you:

- Turn ideas into clear, trackable tasks
- Plan work in focused sprint cycles
- Collaborate transparently as a team
- Deliver value step by step instead of all at once

It moves you from “coding randomly” to working like a real development team.

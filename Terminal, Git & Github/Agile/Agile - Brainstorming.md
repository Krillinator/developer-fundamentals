> **Goal:** Generate many ideas fast — no filtering yet.  
> **Think of it as:** _“Collect first, judge later.”_

## Avoid these fallpits

![[Pasted image 20260211124304.png|150]]
-  Criticism (“that’s stupid”, “won’t work”)
-  Debates / long discussions
-  Estimations (“too big”, “too hard”)
-  Solutions too early (“the best architecture is…”)
-  “Yes, but…” energy

_These do NOT belong in Brainstorming phase_

> [!hint] Scrum Master
>  **Scrum master** holds the line of defense and helps the team move forward when things get complicated, team start discussing tech through debates, keeps time and makes sure everyone participates.

## Best Practice

-  Quantity > quality
-  Be specific, keep it short
-  Build on ideas: “Yes, and…”
-  Questions are allowed (put them in **Questions**)

## Define the Project Direction

1. **Everyone opens Excalidraw**: https://excalidraw.com/
2. **Product Owner creates a shared board**
	- Click **Share** (top right)
	    ![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 12.44.08.png|250]]
	- Copy the link and share it with the team

**Before taking next step, ask yourselves:**
- What are we building?
- Who is it for?
- What problem are we solving?

**Use a timer on 4-6 minutes** 
*Write down ALL your ideas*

Once done, everyone puts down 3 dots on their favourites. 
Discuss and then move on to the next step

## Brainstorming Project Ideas

1. **Create 3 zones on the canvas**
    - **Ideas**
    - **Questions**
    - **Constraints** (tech, knowledge, time)
2. **Set a timer** (5–10 min)
3. **Everyone adds notes silently**
    - One idea per note
    - Short phrases (3–7 words)![[Screenshot 2026-02-11 at 12.57.24.png]]
4. **Dot-vote (optional, 2 min)**
    - Everyone adds up to 3 dots ⭐ on their favorite notes *(per category)*
5. **Capture outcomes** / discuss
    - Screenshot/export the board
    - Move to MVP/prioritization _after_ brainstorming

> [!warning] Reminder
> ### Do not delete
> Save the data somewhere, as the ideas and feedback will be used in the next step

## What is Priority?

> **Priority** decides what should be built first.
> After defining the **MVP**, we still need to decide the order of work.
> Not everything can be built at once.
> 
> **Think of it as:**  
 > _“Choosing what we build first, second, and third.”_

## Why Priority Matters

**Ask yourself this:**  
> _Why are we building dark mode if users still can’t create an account?_

Priority helps the team:
- Build the most important things first
- Avoid working randomly
- Handle dependencies correctly
- Deliver value early

## How to Decide Priority (Simple Method)

Ask three questions:

1. Is this required for the product to work?
2. Does something else depend on this?
3. Does this create high user value?

If the answer is “yes” → it goes higher in the backlog.

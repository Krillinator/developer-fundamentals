## Planning Poker

> **Planning Poker** is a simple way for a team to estimate how much effort a user story requires.  
> It helps the team agree on complexity before committing to work.
> 
> **Think of it as:**  
> _“A quick team vote to understand effort before building.”_

## How It Works

1. Product Owner presents a story
2. Team asks clarifying questions
3. Everyone privately selects a number *(story points)*
4. All reveal at the same time
5. If numbers differ → discuss → vote again

Repeat until the team agrees.

## Why It Matters

- Prevents one person from deciding alone
- Encourages discussion
- Reveals misunderstandings early
- Creates shared ownership

*Planning Poker is about **understanding the work**, not predicting exact hours.*
The **Product Owner** can now decide much easier how to distribute workload over the coming sprints and whether or not it's worth the time and effort.

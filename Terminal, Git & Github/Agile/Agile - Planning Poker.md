## Planning Poker

> **Planning Poker** is a simple way for a team to estimate how much effort a user story requires.  
> It helps the team agree on complexity before committing to work.
> 
> **Think of it as:**  
> _“A quick team vote to understand effort before building.”_

## How It Works

1. Product Owner presents a story
2. Team asks clarifying questions
3. Everyone privately selects a number *(story points)*
4. All reveal at the same time
5. If numbers differ → discuss → vote again

Repeat until the team agrees.

## Get Started: Host

> **Product Owner** begins by navigating to: https://planningpokeronline.com/new-game/
> Pick 'modified fibonacci' --> Create game --> Share Link

> At the top right section you may create new User Stories *(called issues here)* and assign points, revote and get an overview

>This ensures better control when voting, deciding or revisiting certain User Stories

### How do you play?

> Pick an already defined **User Story**, present it and proceed to vote.
> After everyone has voted, discuss the results. 
> Then vote again (if there's no consensus)
> 
> *(If you're unsure about the cards meaning: check out the table section bellow )*

**How many voting rounds?**
 There is no fixed number.

 **Typically:**
 • First vote --> Wide spread of numbers
 • Discussion
 • Second vote --> Closer alignment
 • (Sometimes) Third vote --> Final agreement

 If the team cannot align after 2–3 rounds, the story is likely unclear or too large and should be refined or split.

>[!hint]- The Card Set: Table
>
> | Card | Meaning |
> |------|---------|
> |  ?   | Not enough information or confusing|
> |  ☕  | Break |
> |  0   | No effort (already done / trivial change) |
> | 0.5  | Extremely small change |
> |  1   | Very small task |
> | 2–3  | Small task |
> | 5–8  | Medium complexity |
> | 13   | Large |
> | 20   | Very large |
> | 40   | Extremely large |
> | 100  | Massive |
>
> Story points represent **relative effort, complexity, and uncertainty**.. not time.

>[!info]- What happens after everyone picks?
>
> 1. Everyone reveals their card at the same time.
> 2. If the numbers differ, discussion begins.
> 3. The highest and lowest estimates explain their reasoning.
> 4. The team discusses assumptions, risks, and unknowns.
> 5. The team votes again.
>
> The goal is not to “win” the estimate.
> The goal is shared understanding.
>
> If estimates are very high (40 / 100),
> the story is usually too big and should be split.

## Why Planning Poker Matters

- Prevents one person from deciding alone
- Encourages discussion
- Reveals misunderstandings early
- Creates shared ownership

*Planning Poker is about **understanding the work**, not predicting exact hours.*
The **Product Owner** can now decide much easier how to distribute workload over the coming sprints and whether or not it's worth the time and effort.

## What is MVP?

> **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** is the smallest version of a product that still delivers real value.

**Think of it as:**  
_“The simplest version that works and can be tested.”_

## Why MVP Matters in Prioritization

When the **Product Owner** prioritizes stories, they ask:
"*What do we need to build first to have a usable product?*"

> What should our first presentation be done in? UI, Postman, Swagger..? 
> What about: database tech, and libraries?

**Not**:
- What would be nice?
- What would be cool?
- What would impress people?

**Only**:
- What is essential?

## Example

Let’s say you're building a task app.

Possible features:
- Create task
- Delete task
- Edit task
- User login
- Dark mode
- Task reminders
- Analytics dashboard

MVP might be:
- Create task
- Delete task
- View task list

Everything else comes later.

**An example from the previous brainstorm** 
might be to then mark the relevant MVP related work

## Simple Rule

> *What would you want to show the client?*
> Build what is necessary to make it usable. What is the smallest possible usable version? 
> Improve it after feedback.

That’s why MVP and backlog prioritization go hand in hand.

### What are Agile Roles?

> **Agile roles** define how a team collaborates to plan, build, and deliver software in short iterations.  
> Each role has a clear responsibility to keep focus, quality, and progress aligned.
> 
> **Think of it as:**  
> _“Clear responsibilities that prevent chaos and keep the team moving forward.”_

## How to Assign the Roles

Before we start building, we need clear roles so we don’t step on each other’s toes. 
Let’s quickly decide who takes which responsibility
- Who wants to **own** the product direction and backlog? *(Product Owner)*
- Who feels comfortable facilitating meetings and keeping us on track making sure everyone feels included during the Agile Meetings? *(Scrum Master)*
- The rest are the **development team**.

**Important:**
- The Product Owner decides **what** to build
- The Scrum Master ensures **how the team works**
- Neither role has to be a manager

### Why Agile Roles Matter

Clear roles:

- Reduce confusion
- Improve accountability
- Speed up decision-making
- Support healthy sprint cycles

Without clear roles, planning becomes opinion-driven.  
With roles, the team works as a structured unit.

## When are Scrum Master and Product Owner assigned?

_Both roles are assigned **before the team starts working in sprints**._

Usually:
- When a new project begins
- When a team is formed
- Before the first Sprint Planning

You don’t change roles mid-sprint unless absolutely necessary.

**Simple rule:**

> Set roles before Sprint 1.  
> Keep roles stable during the sprint.

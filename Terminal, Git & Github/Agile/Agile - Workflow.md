# The Sprint Cycle

## Sprint Planning *(Day 1)*

**Goal**: Decide what to build this sprint.

Do this:
1. **Product Owner** presents prioritized stories 
2. **Team** clarifies the story to fully understand what needs to be built *(understanding mission)*
3. **Team** estimates effort (Planning Poker if needed) 
4. **Team** selects stories they can finish
5. **Stories** are assigned to this sprint

*Now the sprint starts.*

## During the Sprint (Daily Work)

**Every day:**
- Short daily standup (What did I do? What will I do? Any blockers?)
- Developers move stories:
    - Todo → In Progress → Done
- Scrum Master removes obstacles
- No new work added to the sprint

**Focus**: Finish what you committed to.

## Sprint Review (End of Sprint)

Goal: Show what was completed.
- Team **demonstrates** finished work
- Stakeholders (clients, customers, managers etc..) give feedback
- **Only** “Done” work is shown

*Pick 1–2 improvements.*

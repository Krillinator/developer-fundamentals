Stage and commit the resolution: git add .\ngit commit -m \"some-commit-message-here\" Push again: git push origin main Success\nYOU DID IT!\nPractice creating a repo, adding files, committing, and pushing to GitHub.\nNext step: learn branches and pull requests for teamwork! “I committed to the wrong branch” Forgetting to create/switch to a feature branch before working.\nFix: use git checkout -b early, or git switch -c. “I deleted files accidentally and Git removed them” Git tracks deletes as well.\nFix: restore with git checkout -- filename or git restore filename. “My files are ignored / not showing up” Usually caused by .gitignore catching them. Merge conflicts Happens when two people change the same line in a file.\nFix: manually edit, then git add and git commit. “Detached HEAD state” Happens when you checkout a specific commit instead of a branch.\nFix: create a new branch from that commit. “Accidentally pushed secrets” (API keys, passwords) Removing them isn’t just deleting — you may need to rewrite history (git filter-repo) or rotate keys. “I want to undo my last commit” git reset --soft HEAD~1 (keep changes staged)\ngit reset --hard HEAD~1 (discard changes) Force push mistakes Overwriting remote history by accident (git push --force).\nCan wipe out teammates’ work. Cloning into the wrong folder Ending up with nested repos (myrepo/myrepo). “I can’t pull because I have local changes” Fix: commit or stash before pulling. Different local vs remote histories (your exact case) Non-fast-forward errors, diverged timelines. Forgot to set upstream branch First push fails → need git push -u origin main. Permission denied (publickey) SSH key not set up properly. Repository not found / 403 error Wrong URL or missing permissions. Large file rejection GitHub blocks files &gt;100MB.

Switch: Shortcut\ngit checkout -b new-feature creates + switches branch\nExample Show all branches:\n$ git branch Delete a local branch:\n$ git branch -d branch-name Delete a remote branch:\n$ git push origin --delete branch-name Warning\nWhen working in a team, creating a branch locally does not make it visible to others.\nIf Person A creates a branch called feature/test-A and pushes it,\nPerson B won’t see it until they fetch the latest changes. To view all branches (both local and remote), run: git branch -a Success\nYOU GOT IT!\nPlay around with creating, switching, and deleting branches to get comfortable.\nCombine this with Pull Requests and Issues to create a professional Git workflow.\n<br>Documentation Read more about Branches at Git’s official documentation: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell\" target=\"_self\">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell</a>\n<br> Back to Overview: <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"index.canvas\" data-href=\"index.canvas\" href=\"index.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Developer Fundamentals</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"What is a Branch?","level":3,"id":"What_is_a_Branch?_0"},{"heading":"A typical Branch workflow looks like..","level":3,"id":"A_typical_Branch_workflow_looks_like.._0"},{"heading":"Why it’s useful","level":3,"id":"Why_it’s_useful_0"},{"heading":"Common Branch Types","level":4,"id":"Common_Branch_Types_0"},{"heading":"Step by Step - Guide","level":3,"id":"Step_by_Step_-_Guide_0"},{"heading":"Prerequisites","level":4,"id":"Prerequisites_0"},{"heading":"#1 Creating and Switching Branches","level":4,"id":"#1_Creating_and_Switching_Branches_0"},{"heading":"#2 Viewing and Managing Branches","level":4,"id":"#2_Viewing_and_Managing_Branches_0"},{"heading":"Now what?","level":3,"id":"Now_what?_0"},{"heading":"Branch - Documentation","level":3,"id":"Branch_-_Documentation_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Finished</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Finished**_0"}],"links":["index.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"terminal,-git-&-github/branching/branches-basics.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["resources/git-branch-workflow-abstract-png.html","resources/git-branch-what-it-is.html","resources/terminal-git-branch-flow-diagram-simplified.png.html","resources/git-branch-benefits.html","resources/git-branch-workflow.html"],"createdTime":1757577262217,"modifiedTime":1769182201957,"sourceSize":3764,"sourcePath":"Terminal, Git & Github/Branching/Branches - Basics.md","exportPath":"terminal,-git-&-github/branching/branches-basics.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":46,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"terminal,-git-&-github/terminal-basics/terminal-&-files-basics.html":{"title":"Terminal & Files - Basics","icon":"<span class=\"cm-iconize-icon\" aria-label=\"LiTerminal\" data-icon=\"LiTerminal\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"display: inline-flex; transform: translateY(13%);\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16px\" height=\"16px\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide-terminal\"><polyline points=\"4 17 10 11 4 5\"></polyline><line x1=\"12\" y1=\"19\" x2=\"20\" y2=\"19\"></line></svg></span>","description":"\nThis section focuses on creating, editing, reading, and filtering files\ndirectly from the command line.. without leaving the terminal.\n<img alt=\"Terminal - icon png.png\" src=\"resources/terminal-icon-png.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 100px; max-width: 100%;\"> <img alt=\"Terminal &amp; Files - icon.png\" src=\"resources/terminal-&amp;-files-icon.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 100px; max-width: 100%;\">\nInfo\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to: Create files and folders\nEdit files using a terminal-based editor\nView file contents\nFilter output using grep Files can be created directly from the terminal.\nExample\nCreate a new file:\ntouch notes.md # Mac / Linux\nNew-Item notes.md # Windows PowerShell Tip\nIf the file already exists, it will not be overwritten.

You create and push a file to GitHub.\nYou rename or delete the file locally.\nYou push again.\nThe old file still exists online.\nThis is confusing.. but very common.\nGit tracks files, not folders\nDeleting or renaming locally does not always update Git automatically\nGitHub only shows what exists in the published branch\nPrerequisites Git installed locally\nA GitHub repository\nBasic Terminal knowledge Step 1 mkdir git-remove-file-demo\ncd git-remove-file-demo\ngit init echo \"First version\" &gt; page.html\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Add initial file\" Push the project to GitHub.\nStep 2 Rename the file without using Git:\nmv page.html index.html\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Rename file locally\"\ngit push Do not fix anything yet.\nStep 3 git ls-files Filter the result:\ngit ls-files | grep html This shows what Git still knows about.\nStep 4 If the old file appears in git ls-files, remove it:\ngit rm page.html\ngit commit -m \"Remove old tracked file\"\ngit push The file will now disappear from GitHub. If a file exists online, it exists in the branch GitHub publishes.\nDeleting a file locally is not enough.Renaming files like this:mv old.html new.html\nInstead, use:git mv old.html new.html\nThis allows Git to understand the change correctly.Success\nWell done!\nYou now know how to remove files from GitHub properly — even when they refuse to disappear.\nDocumentation <a
